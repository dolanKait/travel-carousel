##IMG Carousel

I followed along with WebDevSimplified's [JS-CSS Carousel tutorial](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/js-css-carousel) to try and get more familiar with animations and wanted to try what I learned to use, starting with my favorite place: New York City

I will be working on fixing my js transitions and animations in the future, as well as adding more interaction. Once I've gotten a solid prototype, I hope to extend this project to other locations
